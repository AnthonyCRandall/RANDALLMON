Overview:

Welcome to "Randallmon", a java-based interactive game inspired by the actual Pokemon game. While incomplete, "Randallmon" allows the user to use the WASD keys to navigate around the window, encountering randomized enemies, and deciding whether or not to battle them in my simple battle system that I have incorporated. Essentially I was able to provide a barebone version of the game, but it is nowhere near perfect given that I had limited time to complete towards the end of the semester
