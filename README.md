Overview:

Welcome to "Randallmon", a java-based interactive game inspired by the actual Pokemon game. While incomplete, "Randallmon" allows the user to use the WASD keys to navigate around the window, encountering randomized enemies, and deciding whether or not to battle them in my simple battle system. Essentially I was able to provide a barebone version of the game, but it is not complete given my tight time frame given in class.
